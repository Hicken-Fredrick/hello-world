SCHOOL TIME!

Hey All,
      I love listening to music during almost every minute, it always makes me more calm and lets me get rid of the anxiety that builds up during a day. I listen to everything from electroic to classic but I'll always have a special place in my heart for string instruments they are my favorite.
